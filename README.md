## The April 2022 NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem Hackathon

We are pleased to announce that the NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem will be hosting a hackathon on NIH Common Fund data sets from **April 26 - 29, 2022**. This hackathon has both synchronous and asynchronous work, with concentrated hackathon sessions on specific data sets. Participants can attend whichever hackathon sessions they are interested in. Participants can also form working groups and tackle issues throughout the week organized in a GitHub repository.
